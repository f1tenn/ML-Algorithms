# ML-Algorithms

Hi! This project is dedicated to the development and research of machine learning algorithms that can help us better understand and analyze large amounts of data. In our age, when the amount of information is growing day by day, efficient data processing methods become very important for various fields such as business, medicine and social media.

What is this project about?
I want to create and test new machine learning algorithms that will be able to handle big data. My goal is to optimize these algorithms so that they can process information quickly and accurately.
